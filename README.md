```jsx
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    // make sure it's pointing to the ROOT node_module
    "./node_modules/avent-ui/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

```

### 3. Import any Component

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Magneto } from 'avent-ui';

```
### 4. Use it Anywhere you want

```jsx
<Magneto>
    That simple!!

```
<br/>

## ðŸ“¦ Individual Component Installation
### Don't want to install the entire library ?
We gotchu! If you only need a particular component, you can install it individually to save bundle size:

```jsx
npm install @avent-ui/component-name
```
and follow the regular installation instruction <br/>
